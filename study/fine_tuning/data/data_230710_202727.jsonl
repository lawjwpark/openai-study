There was a lot of sauce inside. and the harmony of the sauce and cheese was so good  It was so delicious.  And it had tomatoes in it. I thought the tomatoes were cut up and put in.

It was so delicious.  I couldn't believe how good the salad was. I was so excited to try the other dishes :)   My favorite mashed potatoes & sauerkraut gravy Potatoes are so good right now. it's bound to be delicious  It's so good with steak :)  I thought it was delicious just by itself.

If you enjoyed the steak, you can add more. It was really delicious.  It was grilled medium rare, which is my favorite grilling method.

{"prompt": "I discovered Ojeje while looking for a restaurant in Gangnam Station   I came here because I wanted to eat tonkatsu after a long time, I didn't realize it would become my favorite tonkatsu restaurant.  I heard that there is a long line on weekdays.  so I went 30 minutes before opening time on the weekend  I made a reservation on site with tabling  I was able to get in at number 1 :)  Business hours 11:00 ~ 21:00Break time 15:30 ~ 17:30 Last order 14:30/20:00TEL. 0507-1342-4659 Address. 201, 358 Gangnam-daero, Gangnam-gu, Seoul (201, 826-14 Yeoksam-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul)50 meters © NAVER Corp. Ozeze Gangnam 201, 2F, 358 Gangnam-daero, Gangnam-gu, Seoul  Previous imageNext image Gangnam Station Restaurant OJEJE Menu & InformationWe ordered tenderloin tonkatsu, pork loin tonkatsu, and zaru udon,  and curry for a total of 45,000 won.We had a very filling breakfast and lunch ^^.  We even had a small problem with the sirloin tonkatsu.  I was able to try all 3 types of tonkatsu unintentionally.   The interior of the store, taken when no one was around  There were a lot of tables, so it seemed that the turnover would be fine even if you visited during lunchtime on a weekday  on a weekday lunchtime when there are many office workers.  The interior also had a sentimental and clean atmosphere  and clean atmosphere that young people like these days, so it looked good as a date course.    The drawer under the table was stocked with cutlery, chopsticks, paper for the tonkatsu sauce, wet wipes, and tissues.  Oh, and the staff were all very friendly!  They asked us if it was our first time and explained how to use it and how to eat it to make it delicious  I think it made the food taste better.   The curry was the first thing I ordered at the Gangnam Station restaurant.  I ordered it because I thought it would be good to dip pork cutlet or eat it with rice I ordered it because I thought it would be good, but it would have been better if it was a little spicy.  The ingredients were very finely chopped, so there was nothing to chew on.  so it was a very digestible curry.   If you order tonkatsu, you also get rice and soup.  The soup tasted just like the soup we usually know, but the rice and soup had the advantage of being refillable. refills were available    Next was the sirloin, my personal favorite!  The batter was very thin but crispy. The meat was moist, with a nice texture and just plain delicious.  I thought, \"That's where all the tonkatsu comes from\", but it was the best tonkatsu I've ever had in my life.   The accompanying salad is a yuzu oriental dressing  yuzu oriental dressing on the table,  The tonkatsu comes with horseradish, tonkatsu sauce, and salt.  But personally, it was the most delicious to eat with salt. I ate it deliciously in the order of salt>horseradish>tonkatsu sauce.  As a restaurant in Gangnam Station, there are many options for sauces.   Next, the specialty I was most looking forward to  It is made with gabrisal and sirloin together.  It was soft and moist, so it was a great sniper for my tastebuds that don't usually like puffy parts  I don't normally like flavorful cuts of meat.  If you like moist and fatty flavors, try the sirloin. If you like soft, light, and savory flavors.  If you like a little bit of fat, I recommend sirloin.   When eating sirloin, you should eat pickles in the middle of your mouth  one by one  If you eat a pickle while feeling a little full.  You can eat it again while feeling refreshed  can eat again   Thanks to this, 2 people ate all 3 tonkatsu.   Next is the tenderloin tonkatsu at Gangnam Station restaurant Ozeze  It looked different from the other menus and was round. and the pepper was sprinkled on top  And even at first glance, you could tell that it was different from  tenderloin tonkatsu before.   When I ordered it, I thought it might be a little fluffy because it was tenderloin.  I thought it might be a little puffy, but as you can see from the juices, it was moist and light.  But the best part was the sirloin!  Even my friend who usually likes tenderloin the sirloin was the most delicious.     Finally, the sack udon served on ice  The noodles were viscous and long, so we were told to eat one or two strands at a time  I was told to eat one or two strands, but I definitely ate it as I said.  It was chewy and delicious   The noodles on the ice were dipped in the radish and wasabi sauce  with radish and wasabi, it was a perfect menu for summer.   I tried everything except the shrimp tempura, and despite my high expectations, I was satisfied with the meal.  The food, the atmosphere, and the service all exceeded our expectations!

{"prompt": "This is my second visit since last October. It's not an easy place to get to, but we were lucky enough to get there right away~.  We were guided to the same room as last time.                 For your information, table seats are 10% service charge,and 20% for private rooms.It's expensive, but the service is definitely good~.  You can see the garden,There are Chinese(?) plates hanging in the front.I'm ashamed of myself because I'm a bit cultured and it would look great.      It's a restaurant with a price tag of over 500,000 won.  I pay attention to the little things, The temperature and texture of the handkerchiefs, the timing of when they're brought in and when they're taken away. The bamboo chopsticks, which are disposable but flimsy and lightly sharpened.     They strive for perfection in everything.  The menu for the day.It's not so easy to read after all~ lol       The first menu item was the same as the previous visit, the flavorful amchae,  with very thin somen noodles.It's just a sip of the soup, but the layers of flavors are so complex that it's like walking a tightrope between tasting like tea and tasting like tea again.  This is the Botan Ebi marinated in Shaoxing wine.No wonder it's so big and flavorful, It's not too wet or soggy, and the texture is really appealing, with my teeth sinking into the flesh like I'm eating lightly dried fish.I usually try to refrain from using exclamatory adverbs.This time, I can't express myself without exclamation points after eating such perfect food~.  The pairing is a creamy, gently chilled octrocha.It washes away the slightly fishy flavor left in my mouth after eating the offal~.  Deep-fried spring rolls with coltsfoot and giant clams.The skin is thin, light, and crisp without any grease, and after chewing, you can taste the strong flavor of the clams and the faint bitterness.  Small pickled vegetables given to me to bite into~.It's not hard to realize that a lot of love went into each of these little things.  The char siu is trimmed and baked for a long time so that you can't feel the tendons at all.The pork belly is pork belly, but the texture is like chewing on tender pork tenderloin.   The flavor is strong, so the wine is strong~.  Here's how I made the chicken wings.You can see the flavor in the picture, right?The thickness of the skin reminds me more of Beijing Duck than chicken.  Jellyfish cold cuts with yuzu skinIf you cleanse your stomach frequently, you can eat them indefinitely.  Is there a trend in pairing? or is there just not a large pool of wines availableor if it's just the same people producing them all.If you go to several restaurants around the same time  there's a lot of overlap in the wine pairings somewhere(?), even though the food is different.  Then it's a bit boring. I don't have anything to do with Mariah.Oh, this is also used here... Oh, my God, it's just an appreciation...Sazenka's pairing didn't have any overlapping wines, and even the last pairing didn't have any overlap~.It's not like they're just switching them around, each one is amazing. I don't know what I'm saying, but if you use Sazenka's pairings as a benchmark, I don't think any of the domestic restaurants would get a passing grade.  Pheasant dumplings in a clear pheasant broth.It reminds me a bit of Pyongyang noodles~.  The harusame was sautéed in XO sauce with a huge northern clam.The clam shell was as big as my palm.   That's half of a conch.The meat seemed to be three times thicker than that of a good sushi restaurant.I've never tasted a clam that fills my mouth like this before, even though it's a big clam.  Once again, the chef served us un pai lu un pai roo.It's a dish of thinly sliced meat and eggplant, but I've never had it in Korea, so I'm not sure what it is~.  Japanese wine is also really good if you don't have any preconceived notions.Ai,,No matter what, Japanese wine?Those who say this, you wouldn't know if you were blind.The spicy food was paired with a 30 year old Dojung Oolong Nangsheng Karasurong tea.In the mouth, it's just water, but when the tea passes through the throat, it gives a heavy feeling, like drinking oil.  The spicy flavor is not direct, but if you dig into the graveyard of peppers used solely to impart the spicy flavor...  There's chicken wings in there.If we could get this delivered from a chicken place.I don't think there would be a debate on the price of 30,000 won for chicken..lol  Drinks can't wait and have been traveling the world from China to France Italy, Japan, and then to New Zealand.  The flavor is spicy, so rinse your mouth out,   Shucks spin in a rusted pietan.I'm honestly not sure what the shakspin tastes like... Is it even a flavor in the first place?I think it tastes like a sauce, but since the sauce is chicken paitan.It's like eating a really good chicken dish.  How do you find and match wines like this?  Same as last time, he makes risotto with the leftover paitan sauce.I don't think many restaurants do this better...   Stir-fried bean stalks to accompany the main meat.  Sazenka-style hot and sour pork,pork ribs are diced, stuck together, and deep-fried on the bone.I'm pretty sure it's starch fried,but how did they manage to fry it so well, not too hard, not too fluffy, and not too greasy? I also loved the flavor of the sauce.    The last wine was the king of the pairing...          It's so clean, not a drop of oil.What, I haven't been drinking?  If you put XO sheets in it, it'll kill you.   And lastly, cooked rice,   and finished off with some delicious mapo tofu.    The dessert has a subtle balance of sweet and not-so-sweet.    Flower tea for the end           Eat one gomadango,  Some of us had birthdays  peach manju, which is said to symbolize longevity.I'm grateful for the care that went into making it, but it's even better that it tastes so good~.   I mentioned it in my previous post,Sazenka is one of only two restaurants that I rank among the best of the best in Tokyo. Not only is every bit of food and every bit of service impeccable, but in many ways the experience far exceeds what you can imagine. Our meal was around $750 (70,000 yen) per person with pairings, and honestly, it's hard to pay that much and feel like the flavors are worth the price.  Nevertheless, the meal far exceeded my expectations. I checked and they are not accepting any new reservations these days.  omakase.inIf there are canceled seats on the above sites, you might be able to get one...        If you can get a reservation, I think it's worth a day trip.Or go with me...I don't want to give you a tip that's just like this.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " {\r\n\"criterion1\": {\r\n\"rating\": \"6/10\",\r\n\"description\": \"The review includes some descriptions of flavors, textures, and specific ingredients.

{"prompt": "One of the reasons I came to Mokpo with Cie. As someone who has a very deep and long-standing attachment to charcuterie, the word \"fishery\" was a trigger in a positive way, and I had such a great experience that I would recommend anyone to organize a trip to Mokpo just for this one.  I had brought a white for the corkage, but it took a while to decant and the weather was still warm, so I ordered a bottle of sparkling to drink right away. At this point, I didn't even realize I had brought wine...  Three amuse bouches. From left: sweet potato mousse with tricorne octopus, beurre popcorn, and jambon bourguignon.  Coincidentally, my first bite at Cie the day before was also a tartlet with a sweet potato base and abalone filling, so it was interesting. The sweet potato's sweetness and dense texture supported the chewy seafood better than I expected.  The dried and deep-fried burette was topped with a little paprika sauce, which was lightly fried like popcorn. It was so thick that it was airy, unlike the crispness of thin chips. The cayenne pepper/pimento flavor is a nice touch that tickles the nose.It's accented with butter made from a mixture of seaweed fishery and dried bonito on top. The flavor of the dried fish provides a nice kick, while retaining the pleasurable carb+fat combination of the jambon beurre. It was an amuse bouche that showcased the allure of salting and drying in that each small bite released a compressed flavor.  Carpaccio of sea bass with apple.  It was served with yuzu sauce and garlic oil, and the solid white sauce you see under the dill is yogurt sauce.I said the same thing in Cie's post, but I don't think sea bass is actually a flavorful fish in and of itself, and it's also a fish that's difficult to discuss meaningfully in many contexts because it's consumed in a very structured way.For him, it's refreshing to see a dish that emphasizes the role of the kitchen rather than convention and ingredients.  Fig leaf oil smoked Wando abalone with herb aioli.  This was so textured, layered, balanced, and perfect that I ate every bite very slowly. I've come across fig leaf oil before in desserts, but never in a regular dish, and its tangy but delicate flavor and aroma worked so well with the abalone, which is also a delicate ingredient. Just when you think you've settled in, the dill blossoms provide a breath of fresh air, and the nutty aioli adds an explosion of flavor.  Fish terrine brandade and red scallop gratin.  The fish was soft and fluffy, with a fine texture, and the flavor of the fish came through nicely with a clear liver, making for a delicious brandade.  On this side, the heated béchamel sauce plays a similar role to the potatoes in the brandade, creating a different impression. At this point, I'd paired it with the sparkling I'd ordered for the first time, but it would also go really well with a stronger white.  The fish terrine platter as an a la carte addition. What a beautiful presentation...  First up was a semi-dry, slightly short-cured raw ham with a variety of spices. It wasn't part of the course, but it was definitely the star of the platter. First of all, the texture is very firm and chewy, like a jelly, which is something you don't often find in meat charcuterie. I didn't ask what kind of spices were used in the flavor, but I felt that it had a higher proportion of cool spices than warm ones, and that, combined with the flavor of the unboiled fish and the fairly high salinity, made me feel like I was swimming in a sea of herbs and spices.  This is the bluefin tuna fish terrine that went on top of the Amuse's seaweed jambon bordeaux. It's completely dry and has been pushed out with a planer like a katsuobushi, which makes for an interesting contrast to the raw ham of the previous dish, as there is very little moisture in the red fish.  Here's the fried skin of the sea bream. On a different note, I'm a big fan of puktae snacks. There was a bar in my old neighborhood where you could order grilled ink-tae and they would remove the skin and deep-fry it separately, and it was an amazing delicacy. After the restaurant went out of business, I hadn't seen a place that did that for a while, so I was very happy to find a similar taste here. I'm not sure if it's a bit rude to the chef here compared to the casual food, but frying chicken skin, which was all the rage at the time, is not 'tasteless' if you fry the skin, which contains fat and collagen in the first place.  The generous serving of popcorn with the boure made up for the disappointment of only getting one bite at Amuse. Even without the paprika sauce, the seasoning itself is rich with a smoky spiciness from cayenne pepper and pimentón.  Don't get me wrong, I ordered extra wine by the glass ^^...(shameless)  Minnow sausage.  The sausage is stuffed with the flesh of the fish and the sauce is made from the bones. The texture and flavor was so impressive that I can still remember it clearly over a month later. The inside of the sausage is very concentrated and flavorful, but it's not the least bit fluffy like the previous brandade, and the sauce, which draws out the gelatin and flavor of the bones, supports the sausage with a richness that's almost as high as the viscosity in the photo.  Anago risotto with fennel pickles.  The risotto alone, made with anago bone broth, is quite flavorful, and the Japanese-style sweet and salty anago is the highlight. The fennel pickles and chervil cut through the punch. At this point, the flavors should take a backseat to the alcohol, but the gradual ascent was so well organized that I was able to enjoy it with a clear head until the end.  It didn't end with two bottles of wine...?  Peppermint ice cream.  It was even better to have such a refreshing dessert while we were still pretty drunk.We hope to see you again in the not too distant future...\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " {\r\n\"criterion1\": {\r\n\"rating\": \"7/10\",\r\n\"description\": \"The review includes descriptions of flavors, textures, and specific ingredients to some extent.

{"prompt": "The store had dodge seats, and there were also seats where you could drink alone and eat alone! Below the sign that says it's a solo bar, it says that they provide OTT services legally? The boss has the best sense!         Seeing how the owner was so relaxed and comfortable with friends, lovers, and solo diners, I decided to try Shamansha for my next honeymoon! (By the way, I'm a solo diner, but the owner is so nice!!)      We made a reservation for a catch table, and they arranged for us to be seated facing each other!    This is the menu. The shabu-shabu is a one-course meal and costs 38,000 won per person. There is also a lunch menu, additional shabu shabu menu, and alcoholic beverages! We ordered two 1-course meals and two clear broths.     This is the basic setup, and they gave us a welcome tea!     The first thing they serve is cheese fondue. With baguette and nachos!     I was surprised by the amount of cheese...(it's a lot...)     The cheese melted faster than I thought! The amount of cheese melted made me impatient, didn't it? I really...really...love cheese, so I wanted to eat it all.     Can you see the cheese stretching out? That's a lot of cheese!!!        And I dipped nachos and baguettes in it! Because there is a lot of cheese, I dip it in it generously and eat it completely... Wow, it's really delicious!!! The cheese flavor is so rich, flavorful, and savory!!!Best....    Oh, and they also give you an apron if you ask! I always spill and eat, so an apron is a must^^.   Now let's try the real shabu-shabu! Put the clear broth in a pot and boil it for 5 times, then add the vegetables and meat and reduce the heat to 3 times.     The vegetables are out~ the amount is huge.... You have to empty your stomach before you go... Boss is really the best!     And the meat came with it! It's Korean beef neck 1++! It's also sprinkled with gold powder! The visual is the best!    Oh, and the Chinese vermicelli that came with the vegetables takes a while to cook, so please put them in first!     And since I love vegetables, I added a lot of them, and the shabu shabu was simmering deliciously! I loved that it was for one person, so I could add whatever I wanted to eat, and I could control the temperature!    Now it's ready to eat!     And don't forget the terrine!    I'll try it!     I tried it once in my favorite peanut sauce~. I also tried it in the melted cheese fondue earlier^lol^.      And the meat!! Meat is the truth after all... The soup is so rich and the meat is so tender!!!     While eating the meat and vegetables, I took out the Chinese vermicelli noodles that I had forgotten about and tried them! Chewy vermicelli noodles are also the truth!!!      Both the staff and the boss were very kind and asked if there was anything lacking and refilled it from time to time... The peanut sauce was killer... They refilled it several times.... And the amount was too much for me, so I gave it to my friend who went with me...!      By the time I was eating deliciously     The seafood came out, squid and shrimp, heart-shaped simpletons, and the shrimp were huge!     Let's try the squid first!     It cooked really fast! I dipped it in peanut sauce, and it was chewy!! I can't believe there is a shabu-shabu restaurant where you can eat both meat and seafood... It was so good!!! The course is perfect!!!     And the shrimp! Can you see the shrimp? They're so big... They don't just give you small shrimp, they give you really big, fresh shrimp... I was so impressed.... 38,000 won? I wanted to.     We were completely full, but there was still room for the last course! You can choose between ramen, barley ramen, and tteokbokki! We chose ramen and tteokbokki, and we were so full that we asked for just a little bit of tteokbokki! Let me show you the ramen first!     The ramen is boiled in the leftover broth! We added shrimp to make it taste like seafood! If you add the leftover cheese fondue on the side, you can make it into cheese ramen!     The broth is tasteless because it's already finished! I was full, but I kept going back for more...     When you're almost done with the ramen, add the egg that came with it! There's nothing missing but shawarma!!! The course is perfect!     I'll try to make tteokbokki too! I put all the leftover broth in it and boil it!    I love cheese, so I added some leftover cheese fondue to it and it tasted like cheese tteokbokki!!! It was a little salty, but that made it even more delicious!!! My stomach was bursting.    The real finishing touch was the lemon sherbet, which was so refreshing and delicious with real lemon squeezes! It was so refreshing as a finishing touch to the salty mouth after eating shabu shabu!!! I want to give this place a 100 out of 100 and I totally recommend it!!!   Whether you want to have a quiet drink or a delicious shabu shabu, you should definitely visit this place!!!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " {\r\n\"criterion1\": {\r\n\"rating\": \"3/10\",\r\n\"description\": \"The review lacks detailed descriptions of flavors, textures, specific ingredients, and their characteristics.

{"prompt": "Yoshikawa is a long-established restaurant famous for its tempura. It's located near Kyoto City Hall, but it's not a tempura restaurant, Yoshikawa is a luxury ryokan that has been in business for over 100 years, and the tempura served for dinner was so popular that they opened a small tempura shop.  The space has a very old feel to it, but it is immaculately maintained.  The lunch course is reasonably priced at 5,500 yen, but if you want to add a single piece outside of the set course, you'll have to pay an additional 3 to 4 thousand yen.  so it's hard to justify the price.

However, I could taste the flavors of the ingredients and the tempura coating was thin and fried well.Not bad for 5500 yen, right?Fukinoto, coltsfoot.  This is a vegetable similar to fern, which is called kogomi in Japan.It has a strong crunchy texture and is characterized by a sticky texture similar to okura.  Eel is also eaten~.
